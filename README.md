White Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the quality of white wine based on various chemical properties. The dataset includes several features such as:

Fixed Acidity: The amount of acid in the wine.
Volatile Acidity: Acidity that can evaporate easily, contributing to the wine's taste.
Citric Acid: A component that can influence the freshness of the wine.
Residual Sugar: The amount of sugar left after fermentation.
Chlorides: The salt content in the wine.
Free Sulfur Dioxide: The amount of free sulfur dioxide present, which helps in preserving the wine.
Total Sulfur Dioxide: The total amount of sulfur dioxide in the wine, including both free and bound forms.
Density: The density of the wine, related to sugar and alcohol content.
pH: The acidity level of the wine.
Sulphates: The presence of sulfur compounds, which can affect taste and preservation.
Alcohol: The alcohol content in the wine.
Quality: The target variable, which represents the wine's quality on a scale.



Methodology: The project uses machine learning algorithms (such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines) to analyze the relationship between these parameters and predict the quality of the wine. The data is preprocessed, normalized, and split into training and testing datasets. Model evaluation is performed using metrics like accuracy, RMSE, and cross-validation.

The insights generated can be useful for wine producers to enhance the quality of their products and for consumers seeking better wine choices based on data-driven predictions.
